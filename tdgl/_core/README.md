# SuperDetectorPy

<!-- ![](example.webp) -->

Everything in this directory, `_core`, is adapted from the
[super-decector-py repo](https://github.com/afsa/super-detector-py/tree/c58ba1b3a8b8e3bf5620ee3f925b5ebd25097dd9), written by Mattias Jönsson.
The README for that repo is copied below.

--------------------------------

SuperDetectorPy is a program used to simulate current-carrying thin-film type-ii
superconductors, such as superconducting single-photon detectors. It is able to:

- Simulate IV curves in general geometries and investigate the 
current crowding effect.
- Investigate the effect of applied magnetic field on superconductors.

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation](https://super-detector-py.readthedocs.io) 
for information on how to get started with SuperDetectorPy.

A video demonstrating how to get started is available on 
[KTH play](https://play.kth.se/media/SuperDetectorPy+workshop/0_udx69wxg).

## Documentation

Documentation is available on 
[Read the Docs](https://super-detector-py.readthedocs.io).
